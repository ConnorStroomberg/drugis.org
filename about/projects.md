Our work on [ADDIS 1.x](/software/addis1) was funded by the Dutch Top Institute Pharma, specifically through the Escher Project workpackage 3.2. The goal of the Escher project was to "engergize pharmaceutical R&D by identifying, evaluating and removing regulatory barriers to bring effacious and safe medicines to patients in an efficient and timely fashion."

In workpackage 3.2, we created evidence-based drug information repositories in which drug efficacy and safety questions can be answered in an efficient, transparent and accountable way. Comparisons within and across medicinal products can now be made in a more automated and, hence, more efficient way.

The following resources were funded by Escher WP 3.2:

 - Dr. Tommi Tervonen, post-doc researcher (2008-09 - 2010-08)
 - Gert van Valkenhoef, PhD student (2009-04 - 2012-12)
 - Software development (1-3 part-time developers, 2009-10 - 2013-06)

Through the commissioned project "industry requirements and a data standard for ADDIS"

 - Hans van Leeuwen
 - Prof. dr. Jozef Aerts

Through the commissioned project "decision support for benefit-risk assessment with imprecise preference information"

 - Dr. Gert van Valkenhoef, post-doc researcher (2013-01 - 2013-06)

<h3>Goal</h3>
<p>Our main goal is to improve the **drug regulation process**, making it more transparent and efficient. 

<h3>Problems</h3>
<p>Current decision making in drug regulation relies entirely on the expert judgment of the assessors. This often doesn't take into account all available evidence to systematically assess the benefit-risk profile. Reliance on subjective assessment hides the reasoning supporting the decision and causes the regulatory process to be insufficiently transparent and traceable. Furthermore, the trade-offs between benefits and risks are seldom made explicit, least quantified. Our project aims to supply a support system that combining proven statistical methods for quantitative benefit-risk assessment with a structured database of evidence from clinical research.</p>

<p>Much of the data used to compare drugs comes from systematic reviews of clinical trials. Typically only the end product of systematic reviewing (a report summarizing the evidence), is made widely available. However, access to the intermediate results of literature searching, publication screening, and data extraction could greatly enhance the efficiency of future reviews. Given the increasing scope of systematic reviews, this uneccessary duplication of effort must be eliminated. This requires a change in the current culture of data protectionism, and suitable software that enables convenient and useful sharing of the intermediate results.</p>

<h3>Approaches</h3>
<p>Our <a href="/software/addis1">previous prototype</a> showed the usefulness of a benefit-risk evaluation support system for local use. We now aim to implement the system as a web platform to ease collaboration. Further, by integrating the entire systematic review process within our system, we aim to capture the intermediate data-enriching steps that a reviewer takes. This improves not only transparency, but also the efficiency of any further systematic review on similar subjects.

<h3>Our Commitment: Open Development</h3>
<p>We are committed to develop our system 'in the open.' This means that we publish our software as early as possible and as often as possible, enabling others to use and critique our software and development process. On this website, we will keep you up to date on the current status of our software and new releases. Furthermore, all source code is made publicly available, under an Open Source license, allowing deep peer-review of our software. Our liberal software licensing also allows others to create spin-off programs from our source code, as long as they likewise make their source code available. </p>

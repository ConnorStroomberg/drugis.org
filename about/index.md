Our Commitment: Open Development
--------------------------------

We are committed to develop our system 'in the open.' This means that we publish our software as early as possible and as often as possible, enabling others to use and critique our software and development process. On this website, we will keep you up to date on the current status of our software and new releases. Furthermore, all source code is made publicly available, under an Open Source license, allowing deep peer-review of our software. Our liberal software licensing also allows others to create spin-off programs from our source code, as long as they likewise make their source code available. 

Our main [objective](/about/objective) is to introduce evidence into medical decision making.
We are a [team](/about/team.html).
We are and have been part of several [projects](/about/projects)

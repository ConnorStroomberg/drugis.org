<p>Because of increasing interest in our GeMTC software for network meta-analysis, there is now a <a href="http://lists.drugis.org/listinfo/gemtc-announce" title="GeMTC">GeMTC release announcements mailing list</a>. Subscribers are kept up-to-date on new releases of the GeMTC GUI and R package. We intend to keep the number of messages to a minimum; no more than about 1 per month. </p>

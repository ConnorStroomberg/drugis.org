<p>We are happy to announce the release of <a href="/addis1.4" title="ADDIS v1.4">ADDIS v1.4</a>. The new release brings enhancements to network meta-analysis that make it possible to do a full analysis in ADDIS. An additional benefit-risk model, Lynd and O'Brien analysis, has been added. Finally, pair-wise meta-analyses can now be corrected for zeroes.</p>

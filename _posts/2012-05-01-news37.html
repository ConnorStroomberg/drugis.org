<p>This new version of <a href="/gemtc">GeMTC</a> re-enables the sorting of studies and treatments in the GUI and fixes a potential problem in the prior generation. The integration with ADDIS has also been improved (expect to see this in the upcoming ADDIS 1.12.4) and the download size was reduced by over 8 MB to 6 MB. </p>

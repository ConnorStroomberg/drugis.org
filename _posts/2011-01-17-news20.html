<p>MTC v0.8 brings the generation of JAGS models back up-to-date with the functionality in ADDIS. Most importantly, node-splitting models can now be generated. In addition, multiple chains with overdispersed starting values are generated and some R code is provided to aid in data analysis. See our <a href="/mtc">MTC page</a> for information and downloads.</p>

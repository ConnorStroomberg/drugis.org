<p>This new version of <a href="/gemtc">GeMTC</a> includes the initial version of a new algorithm for generating node-splitting models. In addition, it was completely rewritten in Java for easier maintenance and to make the source accessible to a wider audience of developers. This also reduces the download size by 5 MB. </p>

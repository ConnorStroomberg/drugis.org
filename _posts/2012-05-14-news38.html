<p><a href="/addis1.12">ADDIS v1.12.4</a> allows the network meta-analysis simulation to be continued if it has not converged yet, and there is a new GUI for checking convergence. The benefit-risk analysis now uses the full covariance information from network meta-analysis, bringing it up-to-date with <a href="/network-br" title="Multi-criteria benefit-risk assessment using network meta-analysis">our JCE paper</a>. In addition, the download size was reduced from 30MB to 15MB, and several bugs have been fixed.</p>

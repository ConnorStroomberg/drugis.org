<p> The ADDIS 1.x software has been very successful as a prototype, and our decision to develop it as a desktop application has allowed us to focus on essential problems in evidence synthesis and decision analysis. However, the ADDIS vision can not be fully realized in a single user environment. The <a href="/files/20130319-addis1-retrospective.pdf">ADDIS 1.x retrospective</a> provides an overview of design decisions made for ADDIS 1.x and their positive and negative consequences. It also identifies key changes that need to be made going forward. </p> <p> The <a href="/files/20130319-addis2-architecture.pdf">ADDIS 2.x requirements and architecture document</a> summarizes the long-term vision and current status of ADDIS, identifies key requirements and proposes an architecture for ADDIS 2.x. Note that this document is focused on architecturally relevant non-functional requirements rather than on specific functional requirements (such as the types of analyses that should be supported). We're currently <a href="/files/20130426-addis-vacancies.pdf">hiring new developers</a> (updated 2013-04-26) to start implementing the new architecture. </p>

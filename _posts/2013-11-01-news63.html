<p>We have just updated our web based multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) preference elicitation tool. This component will be used in ADDIS 2.0 to support benefit-risk decisions. It is currently available online at <a href="http://mcda.clinici.co/">mcda.clinici.co</a>. The new features include:</p> <ul> <li>Workspaces and scenarios: store the intermediate results of preference elicitation in your browser.</li> <li>Overview: shows the elicited preference information in one place.</li> <li>Exact SWING: preference elicitation leading to an exact weighting.</li> <li>Extensive refactoring of the client-side code and many bugfixes on both the client and server side.</li> </ul> <p>You will need a recent browser; we recommend Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome. Several examples are provided. You can also load your own benefit-risk assessments by exporting them from ADDIS 1.16.4 or later. We would be glad to hear your feedback.</p>

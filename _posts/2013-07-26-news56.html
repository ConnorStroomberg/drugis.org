<p>We have just released the first version (0.1) of our web based multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) preference elicitation tool. This component will be used in ADDIS 2.0 to support benefit-risk decisions. It is currently available online at <a href="http://mcda.clinici.co/">mcda.clinici.co</a>.</p> <p>You will need a recent browser; we recommend Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome. Several examples are provided. You can also load your own benefit-risk assessments by exporting them from ADDIS 1.16.4 (released last week). We would be glad to hear your feedback.</p>

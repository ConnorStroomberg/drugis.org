<p>We are happy to announce <a href="/addis0.8" title="ADDIS v0.8">ADDIS v0.8</a>. ADDIS v0.8 introduces network meta-analysis, making ADDIS the first software to offer automatic model generation for network meta-analysis. In addition, your ADDIS data can now be saved as XML, ensuring that you can still use it in future versions of ADDIS.</p>

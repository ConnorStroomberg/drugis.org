<p>Our manuscript "Multi-criteria benefit-risk assessment using network meta-analysis" has been accepted by the Journal of Clinical Epidemiology. The paper details the evidence-synthesis based SMAA benefit-risk model implemented in <a href="/addis">ADDIS</a> since v0.10 (and refined in subsequent versions).</p> <p>The second paper, "Algorithmic Parameterization of Mixed Treatment Comparisons", will appear as an open access article in Statistics and Computing. It discusses how inconsistency models for network meta-analysis can be generated automatically, and so it describes functionality included in both <a href="/addis">ADDIS</a> and our <a href="/mtc">MTC software</a>. <p>See our <a href="/publications">publications page</a> for details on these and other publications.</p>

### Supporting health care policy decisions

FIXME

### Example: ADDIS 1.x for drug regulation

Drug regulators assess the benefits and risks of a new drug based on the evidence provided by the company seeking market approval.
The benefits and risks of a drug should be assessed in comparison with the benefits and risks of drugs already on the market (it would not make sense to approve a drug that is worse than an existing drug).
Ideally, such decisions should take into account "all available evidence."

Current decision making in drug regulation relies entirely on the expert judgment of the assessors.
This often doesn't take into account all available evidence to systematically assess the benefit-risk profile.
Reliance on subjective assessment hides the reasoning supporting the decision and causes the regulatory process to be insufficiently transparent and traceable.
Furthermore, the trade-offs between benefits and risks are seldom made explicit, least quantified.

Within the context of TI Pharma's project Escher, we developed the ADDIS 1.x prototype decision support system that resolves these problems.
We believe the solution lies in combining the MCDA methods for quantitative benefit-risk assessment with a structured database of evidence from clinical research.
This will allow explicitly linking decisions back to their supporting evidence and will also make explicit the ranges of value judgments supporting the decisions made by the regulatory assessors.


### Research Interests

 * The current drug development and regulation process and the existing information systems and standards in this area.
We look at this both to identify opportunities to improve the existing process and to find systems and standards that we can reuse.

 * How to best combine methods for the synthesis of clinical evidence with methods for MCDA benefit-risk assessment to support regulatory decision making.

 * Analysis of the decision workflow supported by our software with the aim of identifying the minimal data model required for the assisted analysis of clinical trials data in a benefit-risk model.

 * How to retrieve as much information as possible about clinical studies from "legacy" information sources.
The information should be machine understandable in the sense that it can be used directly by our decision support software.
The retrieval should require as little user intervention as possible.

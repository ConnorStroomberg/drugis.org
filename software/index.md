The drugis.org project currently maintains the [ADDIS](/software/addis1) software and several [R packages](/software/r-packages).

If you want to be notified when we release a new version of ADDIS, please subscribe to our mailing list [addis-announce](http://lists.drugis.org/listinfo/addis-announce).
On this list, we will make important announcements regarding ADDIS, such as a new release. We expect that at most one e-mail will be sent each month.

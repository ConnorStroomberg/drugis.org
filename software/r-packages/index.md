We have developed several packages for the [R statistical software](http://r-project.org) that implement the core methods we apply to health policy decision making.
It is our hope that these packages provide considerable value to statisticians and decision analysts, and that they will be used as a basis for other software.
The R packages are the foundation for the web-based analysis tools we are developing as part of the [ADDIS 2](/software/addis2) project.

 - [GeMTC](gemtc) for network meta-analysis
 - [SMAA](smaa) for multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) using the SMAA methods
 - [Hit-and-Run](hitandrun) for sampling uniformly from convex shapes

All of these packages are free and open source software, available under the [GNU General Public License, version 3](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html).

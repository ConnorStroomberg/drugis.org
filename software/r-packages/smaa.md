<img src="/images/r-packages/smaa.png" style="float:right">

The `smaa` package for R provides an implementation of the Stochastic Multi-criteria Acceptability Analysis (SMAA) family of methods for multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) with uncertainty in the measurements and/or preference information.
It can be used together with the [Hit-and-Run](/software/r-packages/hitandrun) package for sampling weights with imprecise preference information.

The manual and changelog are available on CRAN and the source code on GitHub:

 - [smaa on CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/smaa/)

```

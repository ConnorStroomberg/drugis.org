We are proud to announce the completely revised and revamped website for drugis.org! 
The site has been rebuilt from the ground up to make it look more modern, and to make it easier to update.
The content has also been revised in light of the [ADDIS 2](/software/addis2) project, which is now in full swing thanks to our funding from the IMI GetReal consortium.

In case you're curious, this is what the site looked like in the past:

We are happy to announce the official launch of [mcda.drugis.org](https://mcda.drugis.org), our web-based tool for multiple criteria decision analysis.
The tool supports the elicitation of partial value functions and criteria trade-offs using several methods, and makes use of our R packages and the Patavi web service wrapper to compute the MCDA results.

This is the first component of the ADDIS 2 project to be launched.
Its development has allowed us to prove the feasibility of a number of our architectural decisions, as well as further define the components and frameworks that will be used in ADDIS 2.
